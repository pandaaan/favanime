                            deplores the state of the world—tests the deadly notebook by writing a criminal's name in it.
                            When the criminal dies immediately following his experiment with the Death Note, Light is greatly
                            surprised and quickly recognizes how devastating the power that has fallen into his hands could

                        <p>Taking a break from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo, Souta Tawara returns to his hometown in Kagawa.
                            Though his parents are no longer around, his former home and family-owned udon restaurant reminds
                            him of the times his family was still together. Reminiscing about his childhood, Souta enters
                            the udon restaurant and discovers a grimy young boy sleeping. At first, Souta thinks nothing
                            of the chance encounter and provides the boy with food and clothing. However, to his surprise,
                            the boy suddenly sprouts a furry pair of ears and a tail! Souta soon learns that the nameless
                            boy is actually the rumored shapeshifting tanuki that has been inhabiting Kagawa for many years.
                            Thinking that the boy has been living a lonely life, he decides to take him in and name him Poko.
                            Udon no Kuni no Kiniro Kemari follows the heartwarming relationship between Souta and Poko, and
                            through the time they spend together, Souta recalls his own past, the place he left behind for
                            the city, and the relationship he had with his father.
